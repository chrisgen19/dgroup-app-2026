This is a great project idea. Since you are familiar with React/Next.js and Express, this stack is perfect for a Dgroup app.A Dgroup is more than just a chat group; it is about spiritual growth, accountability, and meeting consistency. Therefore, the app needs features that support discipleship, not just communication.Here is a structured plan for the app logic, database design, and expanded feature set.1. Core Logic & StructureA. User Roles & PermissionsUnlike a standard chat app, Dgroups have a hierarchy.Member: Can chat, post prayer requests, view resources.Leader: Can remove members, edit group settings, mark attendance, and promote "Apprentices" (Co-leaders).Admin (Super User): CCF Pastors/Staff who oversee multiple Dgroups.B. The "Invite Logic" (Viral Growth)To make joining easy but secure (since Dgroups are personal):Dynamic Links: Instead of just a group ID, generate a unique hash (e.g., dgroup.app/join/xc9-22a).Logic: When a user clicks the link $\rightarrow$ App checks if the token is valid $\rightarrow$ Adds user to Group_Members table with role: member $\rightarrow$ Redirects to the Group Dashboard.Approval Mode: A toggle for leaders: "Auto-accept via link" vs. "Request to Join" (Leader must approve).2. Database Schema (Conceptual)Since you use Next.js/Express, here is how your SQL (or NoSQL) structure might look:Users Table: id, name, email, satellite_location (e.g., CCF Main, Alabang), life_stage (Single, Married).Groups Table:id, name, leader_id, schedule (e.g., "Fridays 7PM"), location_type (Online/F2F), tags (e.g., #Couples, #B1G).status: Public (Searchable) or Private (Invite Only).Group_Members Table: user_id, group_id, role (Leader, Apprentice, Member), joined_at.Posts Table: group_id, author_id, content, type (Announcement, Devotional, Prayer Request).Meetings Table: group_id, date, topic, attendance_count.3. Expanded Feature Set (The "Dgroup" Special Sauce)Here are specific features that tailor the app to the CCF/Discipleship context:A. The "4Ws" Meeting Assistant (For Leaders)Dgroups follow the Welcome, Worship, Word, Works format.Feature: A "Start Meeting" button for leaders.Logic:Welcome: Shows an icebreaker question generator.Worship: Embeds a YouTube link to a worship song or links to a Spotify playlist.Word: Pulls the latest CCF Sunday Chronicle (discussion guide) automatically via PDF or text parser.Works: A checklist for the group's prayer points or outreach plans.B. Prayer Request Wall (Accountability)Group chats get messy. Prayer requests often get buried under memes or logistics.Feature: A dedicated tab called "Prayer Wall."Logic: Members post a request $\rightarrow$ Other members tap a "Prayed" button (gives a notification: "John prayed for you").Archive: Requests can be marked as "Answered" to build a history of God's faithfulness (a "Testimony Log").C. "Find a Dgroup" (Smart Search)Logic: Filters are crucial here because people want groups relevant to them.Filters:Location: GPS radius or specific Satellite (e.g., "CCF Eastwood").Schedule: "Weekday Evenings" or "Saturday Mornings."Demographic: "Singles (20s-30s)," "Couples," "Parents," "Men Only."D. Attendance & Health CheckFeature: Automated attendance tracking.Logic: If the "Start Meeting" mode is used, the app detects who is online/present.Retention Flag: If a member hasn't opened the app or attended a meeting in 3 weeks, flag them to the Leader: "Reach out to Mark, he's been absent."4. User Flow Design (UI Screens)Here is how the user would navigate the app:1. Onboarding ScreenLogin/Register.Profile Setup: "Select your satellite" (e.g., Main, Alabang) and "Life Stage" (e.g., Single, Married). This data feeds the search algorithm.2. Home DashboardIf not in a group: "Find a Dgroup" (Map/List view) or "Create Dgroup."If in a group: "Next Meeting: Friday 7 PM."Daily Devotion: A quick verse or link to the daily Bible reading (since you are already building a Bible tracker, you could integrate that logic here!).3. The Group Hub (The Main View)Header: Group Name + "Video Call" button (Zoom/Google Meet link integration).Tabs:Chat: Standard group messaging.Board: Pinned posts, announcements, and the "Prayer Wall."Resources: PDF uploads (Chronicles) or links.Members: List of people (Leader has a star icon).4. Admin/Leader Tools"Invite Member" (Generates Link/QR Code)."Edit Schedule.""Split Group" (The ultimate goal of a Dgroup is to multiply; this feature clones the group structure for a new apprentice leader).5. Technical RecommendationSince you are using Next.js, I recommend:Backend: Next.js API routes or a separate Express server.Real-time Chat: Socket.io (for Express) or Pusher (easier implementation for notifications/chat).Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase or Neon) is great for relational data like groups and memberships.Authentication: Clerk or NextAuth (simplifies the Google/Social login flow).
